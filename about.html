            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                CAC Unchangeable Changer Love is a vibrant congregation within the Christ Apostolic Church (CAC) family, 
                dedicated to proclaiming the unchanging Gospel of Jesus Christ. Located at Plot 14, 2nd Avenue, Victory 
                Estate, Makogi Extension, we are a beacon of hope and transformation in our community.
            </p>
            <p>
                Founded on the principles of fervent prayer, dynamic worship, and unwavering faith, our church seeks to 
                bring deliverance, healing, and divine favor to all who enter our doors. We draw inspiration from the 
                rich heritage of the CAC, blending English and Yoruba services to unite our diverse congregation in 
                worship and service to God.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our mission is to nurture spiritual growth, empower families, and impact lives through the love of Christ. 
                Whether through our Sunday services, Bible study sessions, or community outreach programs, we strive to 
                be a place where the unchangeable power of God changes lives for eternity.
